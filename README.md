## ⭐ Hi, I'm dywoq, a programmer-cube! 

Rustacean working on a hobby operating system from scratch (UEFI -> Kernel -> Userspace).
Everything is written in 100% safe Rust where possible.

If I need something fast and simple, I reach for Go - especially in CLI tools and anything that talks to the outside world.
